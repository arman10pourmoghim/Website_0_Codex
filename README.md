# AI Health Blog

This repository contains a static demo website focused on the application of Artificial Intelligence in health and hygiene.

All files required for the site live inside the `frontend/` directory. It can be hosted directly with GitHub Pages by enabling Pages for the repository and selecting that folder as the source.

## Running Locally

Simply open `frontend/index.html` in your browser or use any static file server to preview the site.

The blog posts displayed on the home page are loaded from `posts.json` and are purely static examples.

## Future Enhancements

The original project included a Flask backend with an administrative dashboard. It has been removed so the website works entirely as a static site. The backend can be reintroduced later if dynamic functionality is needed.
